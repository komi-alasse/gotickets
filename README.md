# Tickets-API

A RESTful API written in Golang to store and retrieve ticket information.

This is a RESTful API built on top of the gin-gonic/gin package that uses a MySQL database in order to store and retrieve ticket information, though it can also be used for other types of data.

## Installation

To test out the API, clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/komi-alasse/tickets-api.git`

Note: In order to use this API you must have access to a MySQL server, you can install MySQL using Homebrew `brew install mysql` or through downloading the MySQL database from https://www.mysql.com/

## Usage

From there you can simply run `go run .` from the project repository to initiate a server which will run from the command line. 

At any point you can enter `Ctrl-C` to stop the process.
